T-Tests: Use when comparing means between two groups or when comparing a sample mean to a population mean.

Q-Q Plots: Use to check the distribution of your data, especially for assessing normality assumptions. AND 
Use Q-Q plots to assess if your data follows a specific distribution (e.g., normal distribution). If your data points fall close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot, it suggests that your data follows the specified distribution. Q-Q plots are often used to check the assumption of normality in statistical analyses.

ANOVA: Use when comparing means across multiple groups (more than two) or when analyzing the effects of multiple categorical variables.


using Spearman's correlation when one var is normal distributed and the other one is positive skewed / negative skewed 
only use Pearson Correlation when both are normal distributed
